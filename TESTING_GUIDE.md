# 🧪 PennApps Meetup App Testing Guide

Welcome to the testing guide! This will help you verify that your app is working correctly. Think of this like a checklist for a pilot before takeoff - we want to make sure everything is working before we fly! ✈️

## 🎯 **What We're Testing**

We want to make sure:
- ✅ The backend server is running and responding
- ✅ The mobile app loads on your phone
- ✅ Deep links work (like `pennapps://join/abc123`)
- ✅ All the buttons and navigation work
- ✅ Error handling works when things go wrong

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Testing Process**

### **Step 1: Start the Backend Server (The Brain)**

First, let's start the backend server. This is like turning on the engine of a car:

**Open Terminal 1 and run:**
```bash
cd python-backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

> **💡 What's happening**: We're starting the Python server that handles all the data and API requests. The `--reload` flag means it will automatically restart when you make changes to the code.

**✅ Success looks like:**
```
Starting PennApps Meetup API...
Mock mode: True
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### **Step 2: Start the Mobile App (The Interface)**

Now let's start the mobile app development server:

**Open Terminal 2 and run:**
```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

> **💡 What's happening**: This starts the Expo development server that serves your mobile app. The `--tunnel` flag creates a secure connection so you can test on your phone even if you're on a different network.

**✅ Success looks like:**
```
› Metro waiting on exp://192.168.1.100:8081
› Scan the QR code above with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)
```

### **Step 3: Test the Backend API (Make Sure the Brain Works)**

Let's test if our backend server is working properly. This is like checking if the engine is running smoothly:

**Open Terminal 3 and run:**
```bash
python3 test_api.py
```

> **💡 What's happening**: This script sends test requests to our backend server to make sure it's responding correctly. It's like knocking on someone's door to see if they're home.

**✅ Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Testing PennApps Meetup API
==================================================
🔍 Testing health endpoint...
Status: 200
Response: {'status': 'healthy', 'timestamp': '...', 'mock_mode': True}

🔍 Testing accept invite endpoint...
Status: 200
Response: {'meetup_id': '...', 'success': True, 'message': 'Successfully joined the meetup!'}

✅ All tests completed!
```

> **💡 Learning Note**: Status 200 means "OK" - the server is working correctly. If you see any other numbers (like 404 or 500), something is wrong.

### **Step 4: Test the Mobile App on Your Phone**

Now let's get the app running on your actual phone:

1. **Install Expo Go** on your phone:
   - **iPhone**: Download from App Store
   - **Android**: Download from Google Play Store

2. **Scan the QR code** from Terminal 2:
   - **iPhone**: Use your Camera app to scan the QR code
   - **Android**: Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code

3. **Wait for the app to load** (first time may take 1-2 minutes)

> **💡 What's happening**: Expo Go is like a special browser for React Native apps. It lets you test your app on your phone without having to build and install it through the app store.

### **Step 5: Test the Core Features**

Now let's test each part of the app to make sure it works:

#### **🏠 Home Screen Test - The Main Menu**
- **What to look for**: Should show "My Meetups" with an empty state
- **What to do**: Tap "Create Your First Meetup" button
- **Expected result**: Should show an alert (this is a placeholder for now)

> **💡 Learning Note**: The home screen is like the main menu of a video game - it's where you start and can access all the other features.

#### **🔗 Deep Link Test - The Magic Link**
This is a really cool feature! Let's test if people can join meetups through special links:

1. **Open a web browser** on your phone
2. **Type this URL**: `pennapps://join/demo123abc`
3. **Press Enter**
4. **Expected result**: Should open the app and show a join screen
5. **Tap "Join Meetup" button**
6. **Expected result**: Should show a success message

> **💡 Learning Note**: Deep links are like special doorways that can open your app from anywhere. It's like having a secret entrance to your house that only works with a special key.

#### **📱 App Navigation Test - Moving Around**
- **Test all buttons**: Make sure they respond when you tap them
- **Test navigation**: Go between different screens
- **Test loading states**: Look for loading spinners or "Please wait" messages
- **Test error handling**: Try to break things and see if the app handles it gracefully

> **💡 Learning Note**: Navigation is like moving between rooms in a house. Each screen is a different room with different purposes.

### **Step 6: Test Backend Endpoints Manually (Advanced)**

If you want to test the backend directly (like a mechanic checking the engine), you can use these commands:

**Health Check (Is the server alive?):**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
> **💡 What this does**: Sends a simple request to check if the server is running. Like checking if someone is home by ringing the doorbell.

**Accept Invite (Test joining a meetup):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/accept_invite \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token": "demo123abc", "user_id": "test-user"}'
```
> **💡 What this does**: Simulates someone joining a meetup using a special token. Like using a special key to enter a private club.

**Soft Ban (Test the reporting system):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/soft_ban \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"meetup_id": "demo-meetup", "target_user_id": "bad-user", "enacted_by": "moderator"}'
```
> **💡 What this does**: Tests the reporting system that temporarily bans users who misbehave. Like a bouncer at a club.

## 🎯 **What Should Be Working**

### **✅ Core Features (The Must-Haves)**
- [x] **Backend API**: Server responds to requests
- [x] **Deep Links**: `pennapps://join/token` opens the app
- [x] **Join Flow**: Users can join meetups via links
- [x] **Error Handling**: App shows helpful messages when things go wrong
- [x] **Navigation**: Buttons work and take you to different screens
- [x] **UI Components**: Everything looks good and responds to touch

### **🔄 Demo Mode Features (Fake Data for Testing)**

- [x] **Mock Invite Tokens**: Test tokens like "demo123abc"
- [x] **Mock Authentication**: Simulated user login
- [x] **Simulated Responses**: Fake but realistic API responses

> **💡 Learning Note**: Mock data is like using fake money in a board game - it lets you test everything without using real resources.

### **📋 Test Scenarios (What to Try)**

#### **1. The Happy Path (Everything Works)**
- Open app → See empty state
- Use deep link → Join meetup → Success message
- Navigate between screens → Everything works smoothly

#### **2. Error Handling (When Things Go Wrong)**
- Try invalid token → Should show error message
- Turn off internet → Should show retry option
- Try to access without login → Should prompt to sign in

#### **3. User Experience (How It Feels to Use)**
- Loading states → Should show spinners or "Please wait"
- Error messages → Should be helpful and not scary
- Button interactions → Should feel responsive
- Navigation flow → Should feel natural and intuitive

> **💡 Learning Note**: Testing error handling is like testing the brakes on a car - you hope you never need them, but you want to make sure they work when you do!

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting - When Things Go Wrong**

Don't worry! Every programmer runs into problems. Here's how to fix the most common issues:

### **Backend Issues (Server Problems)**

**Problem**: "Cannot connect to API" or backend not responding

**Solution**:
```bash
# First, check if the backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# If it's not running, restart it
cd python-backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

> **💡 Learning Note**: This is like restarting your computer when it's acting up. Sometimes servers need a fresh start too!

### **Frontend Issues (App Problems)**

**Problem**: "App won't load" or stuck on loading screen

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear the Expo cache (like clearing your browser cache)
npx expo start --clear

# Or try tunnel mode for better connectivity
npx expo start --tunnel
```

> **💡 Learning Note**: Caches store temporary data to make things faster, but sometimes they get corrupted. Clearing them is like cleaning out your closet - it makes everything work better.

### **Common Issues and Quick Fixes**

| Problem | What It Means | How to Fix |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| "Cannot connect to API" | Backend server isn't running | Start the backend server |
| "App won't load" | Frontend cache is corrupted | Clear Expo cache with `--clear` |
| "Deep link not working" | Network connectivity issue | Use `--tunnel` mode |
| "Mock data not showing" | Backend not responding | Check backend logs in terminal |
